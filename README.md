# ML Model Deployment Benchmarks

A collection of experiments I'm doing to benchmark the various deployment
options available. The aim is to benchmark the performance of the various
options and also provide you with the pros and cons of each method so that you
can make an informed decision about the framework that would work best for you.

To be fair there are a lot of factors that should be considered when choosing a
framework and if there is anything I left out please open an issue to let me
know you sugetions.

### Frameworks covered

  1. Flask (default)(standard)
  2. [Bentoml](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML)

  
### Models types

The type of model you are using significantly impacts the performance and the
methods of deployment. ML can be used on a wide range of problems so even though
I can't cover all cases, the aim is to cover the most popular ones.
